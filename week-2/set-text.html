        When Marx undertook his analysis of the capitalist mode of production, 
        that mode was in its infancy.2 Marx adopted an approach which gave his 
        investigations prognostic value. Going back to the basic conditions of 
        capitalist production, - he presented them in a way which showed what 
        could be expected of capitalism in the future. What could be expected, it 
        emerged, was not only an increasingly harsh exploitation of the proletar-
        iat but, ultimately, the creation of conditions which would make it possi-
        ble for capitalism to abolish itself. 
        Since the transformation of the superstructure proceeds far more 
        slowly than that of the base, it has taken more than half a century for the 
        change in the conditions of production to be manifested in all areas of 
        culture. How this process has affected culture can only now be assessed, 
        and these assessments mllst meet certain prognostic requirements. They 
        do not, however, call for theses on the art of the proletariat its sei-
        zure of power, and still less for any on the art of the classless society. They 
        call for theses defining the tendencies of the development of art under the 
        present conditions of production. The dialectic of these conditions of 
        production is evident in the superstructure, no less than in the economy. 
        Theses defining the - developmental tendencies of art can therefore con-
        tribute to the political struggle in ways that it would be a mistake to un-
        19 
        20 PRODUCTION, REPRODUCTION, AND RECEPTION 
        derestimate. They neutralize a number of traditional concepts-such as 
        creativity and genius, eternal value and mystery-which, used in an un-
        controlled way (and controLling them is difficult today), allow - factual 
        material to be manipulated in the interests of fascism. In what follows, 
        the concepts which are - introduced into the theory of art differ from those 
        now current in that they are completely useless for the l)urposes of fas-
        cism. On the other hand, they are useful for the formulation of revolu-
        tionary demands in the politics of art [Kunstpoliti/~]. 
        II 
        In principle, the work of art has always been reproducible. Objects made 
        by humans could always be copied by humans. Replicas were made by 
        pupils in practicing for their craft, by masters in - disseminating their 
        works, and, finally, by third parties in pursuit of profit. But the techno-
        logical reproduction of artworks is something new. Having appeared in-
        termittently in history, at widely spaced intervals, it is now being adopted 
        with ever-increasing intensity. Graphic art was first made technologically 
        reproducible by the woodclLt, long before written language became re-
        producible by movable type. The enormous changes brought about in 
        literature by movable type, the technological reproduction of writing, 
        are well known. But they are only a special case, though an important 
        one, of the phenomenon considered here from the perspective of world 
        history. In the course of the Middle Ages the woodcut was supplemented 
        by engraving and etching, and at the beginning of the nineteenth century 
        by lithography. 
        Lithography marked a fundamentally new stage in the technology of 
        reproduction. This much more direct process-distinguished by the fact 
        that the drawing is traced on a stone, rather than incised on a block of 
        wood or etched on a copper plate-first made it possible for graphic art 
        to market its products not only in large numbers, as previously, but in 
        daily changing variations. Lithography enabled graphic art to provide an 
        illustrated accompaniment to everyday life. It began to keep pace with 
        movable-type printing. But only a few decades after the invention of li-
        thography, graphic art was surpassed by photography. For the first time, 
        photography freed the hand from the most important artistic tasks in the 
        process of pictorial reproduction-tasks that now devolved upon the eye 
        alone. And since the eye perceives more swiftly than the hand can draw, 
        the process of pictorial reproduction was enormously accelerated, so that 
        THE WORK OF ART: SECOND VERSION 21 
        it could now keep pace with speech. Just as the illustrated newspaper vir-
        tually lay hidden within lithography, so the sound film was latent in pho-
        tography. The technological reproduction of sound was tackled at the 
        end of the last century. Around 1900, technological reproduction not 
        only had reached a standard that permitted it to reproduce all known 
        worl?s of art, profoundly modifying their effect, but it also had captured 
        a place of its own among the artistic processes. In gauging this standard, 
        we would do well to study the impact which its two different manifesta-
        tions-the reproduction of artworks and the art of film-are having on 
        art in its traditional form. 
        III 
        In even the most perfect reproduction, one thing is lacking: the here and 
        now of the work of art-its unique existence in a particular place. It is 
        this unique existence-and nothing else-that bears the mark of the his-
        tory to which the work has been subject. This history includes changes to 
        the physical structure of the work over time, together with any changes 
        in ownership. Traces of the former can be detected only by chemical or 
        physical analyses (which cannot be performed on a reproduction), while 
        changes of ownership are part of a tradition which can be traced only 
        from the standpoint of the original in its present location. 
        The here and now of the original underlies the concept of its authen-
        ticity, and on the latter in turn is founded the idea of a tradition which 
        has passed object down as the same, identical thing to the pres-
        ent day. The whole sphere of authenticity eludes technological-and of 
        course tIot only technological-rel)roduction. But whereas the authentic 
        work retains its full authority in the face of a reproduction made by 
        hand, which it brands a forgery, this is not the case with techno-
        logical reproduction. The reason is twofold. First, technological repro-
        duction is more independent of the original than is manual reproduction. 
        For example, in photography it can bring out aspects of the original that 
        are accessible only to the lens (which is adjustable and can easily change 
        viewpoint) but not to the human eye; or it can use certain processes, such 
        as enlargement or slow motion, to record images which escape natural 
        optics altogether. This is the first reason. Second, technological reproduc-
        tion can place the copy of the original in situations which the original it-
        self cannot attain. Above ali, it enables the original to meet the recipient 
        halfway, whether in the form of a photograph or in that <1 gramophone

        record. The cathedral leaves its site to be received in the studio of an art 
        lover; the choral work performed in an auditorium or in the open air is 
        enjoyed in a private room. 
        These changed circumstances may leave the artwork's other properties 
        untouched, but they certainly devalue the here and now of the artwork. 
        And although this can apply not only to art but (say) to a landscape 
        moving past the spectator in a film., in the work of art this process 
        touches on a highly sensitive core, more vulnerable than that of any natu-
        ral object. That core is its authenticity. The authenticity of a thing is the 
        quintessence of all that is transmissible in it from its origin on, rang-
        ing from its physical duration to the historical testimony relating to it. 
        Since the historical testimony is founded on the physical duration, the 
        former, too, is jeopardized by reproduction, in which the physical dura-
        tion plays no part. And what is really jeopardized when the historical tes-
        timony is affected is the authority of the object, the weight it derives from 
        tradition. 
        One might focus these aspects of the artwork in the concept of the 
        aura, and go on to say: what withers in the age of the technological 
        reproducibility of the work of art is the latter's aura. This process is 
        symptomatic; its significance extends far beyond the realm of art. It 
        might be stated as a general formula that the technology of reproduction 
        detaches the reproduced object from the sphere of tradition. By replicat-
        ing the work many times over, it substitutes a mass existence for a unique 
        existence. And in lJermitting the reproduction to reach the recipient in his 
        or her own situation, it actualizes that which is reproduced. These two 
        processes lead to a massive upheaval in the domain of objects handed 
        down fro111 the past-a shattering of tradition which is the reverse side of 
        the present crisis and renewal of humanity. Both processes are intimately 
        related to the mass movements of our day. Their most powerful agent is 
        film. The social significance of film, even-and especially-in its most 
        positive form, is inconceivable without its destructive, cathartic side: the 
        liquidation of the value of tradition in the cultural heritage. This phe-
        nomenon is most apparent in the great historical films. It is assimilating 
        ever more advanced positions in its spread. When Abel Gance fervently 
        proclaimed in 1927, "Shakespeare, Rembrandt, Beethoven will make 
        films .... All legends, all mythologies, and all myths, all the founders of 
        religions, indeed, all religions, ... await their celluloid resurrection, and 
        the heroes are pressing at the gates, ') he was inviting the reader, no doubt 
        unawares, to witness a comprehensive liquidation.3

        IV 
        Just as the entire mode of existence of human collectives changes over 
        long historical periods, so too does their mode of perception. The way in 
        which human perception is organized-the medium in which it occurs-
        is conditioned not only by nature but by history. The era of the migra-
        tion of peoples, an era which saw the rise of the late-Roman art industry 
        and the Vienna Genesis, developed not only an art different from that of 
        antiquity but also a different perception. The scholars of the Viennese 
        school Riegl and Wickhoff, resisting the weight of the classical tradition 
        beneath which this art had been buried, were the first to think of using 
        such art to draw conclusions about the organization of perception at the 
        time the art was produced.4 However far-reaching their insight, it was 
        limited by the fact that these scholars were content to highlight the for-
        mal signature which characterized perception in late-Roman times. They 
        did not attempt to show the social upheavals manifested in these changes 
        in perception-and perhaps could not have hoped to do so at that time. 
        Today, the conditions for an analogolls insight are more favorable. And if 
        changes in the medium of present-day perception can be understood as a 
        decay of the aura, it is possible to demonstrate the social determinants of 
        that decay.`;
